# Overview

This is a classic "login" program that works in the console. The idea is the user can 
create an account or log in. If the user logs in, the system will check if their username
and password is in the system, and if not, it will reject them. If the user creates an
account, it will add their new username and password to the system.

I wrote this software to teach myself C++. I specifically wanted to explore pointers, because
I have never programmed with pointers before. 

Elements of this project:
* Use of functions and classes
* Use of .h files (header files)
* Use of pointers
* Saving and loading to a file

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to do this project, because it has a nice pre-made "C++ Console App" 
project template.

I developed this project using C++, and I havent used any extra libraries.
