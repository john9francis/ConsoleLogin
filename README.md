# Overview

This is a classic "login" program that works in the console. The user can 
create an account or log in. If the user logs in, the system will check if their username
and password is in the database, and if not, it will reject them. If the user creates an
account, it will add their new username and password to the database.

I wrote this software to teach myself C++. This project demonstrates the following:
* Use of functions and classes
* Use of .h files (header files)
* Inheritance
* virtual and override functions

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio to do this project, because it has a nice pre-made "C++ Console App" 
project template.

I developed this project using C++, and I havent used any extra libraries.

# Future Work

- Create a way to save and load the database to a file
- Create a way for the user to reset their password without having to create a whole new account
- Impliment pointers for more dynamic memory allocation
